      <b>Equinox</b>
<p>Elizabeth Alexander</br>

<p>Now is the time of year when bees are wild</br>
and eccentric. They fly fast and in cramped</br>
loop-de-loops, dive-bomb clusters of conversants</br>
in the bright, late-September out-of-doors.</br>
I have found their dried husks in my clothes.</br>

<p>They are dervishes because they are dying,</br>
one last sting, a warm place to squeeze</br>
a drop of venom or of honey.</br>
After the stroke we thought would be her last</br>
my grandmother came back, reared back and slapped</br>

<p>a nurse across the face. Then she stood up,</br>
walked outside, and lay down in the snow.</br>
Two years later there is no other way</br>
to say, we are waiting. She is silent, light</br>
as an empty hive, and she is breathing.</br>
